We are doing a game project for our Game Programming course. Here is our idea:

We plan to develop an educational runner game inspired by ”Subway Surfers”, incorporating mathematical learning elements. The player controls a character continuously running forward on a two-lane track. Our first level would be like this: This level is to help kids understand the concept of even and odd numbers. The player will get a random number initialized (from 1 to 3). The player needs to collect 'operator' cookies, such as "add 3", "times 2", "divide by 3", etc. When the player hit the cookie, the number will be updated according to the operator. After getting a cookie, the player will go through a even gate which checks if the number is even or odd. If the number is even, the player will get a score. If the number is odd, the player will lose a life. The player will have 3 lives. The game will end when the player loses all lives. Then the player will face more cookie plus gate challenges. And as the game goes on, the player will speed up so that the player needs to make quick decisions.

What do you think? Can you guide us to start coding and doing things in Unity engine? Thanks!
